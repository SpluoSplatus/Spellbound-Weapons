- LETS GET MODDING / LEARNING

Now that you have (hopefully!) read the license above, lets get started modding 
and understanding this pack to your liking! Obviously, modified versions of this
pack may NOT be redistributed to others, but many people (including myself, Splatus)
like to look at other packs code, and take a bit on inspiration to learn to code
themselves. This pack can be a great help to helping you make your own custom items
as well.

(Just please dont make a custom item and call it an addition to Spellbound Weapons,
just be original, its not really an addon since most packs are already compatible
with each other anyways. If you're confused about anything i just said, pls read 
the license)





============================================
--- PRE MODDING STUFF ---
============================================

First things first, if you wanna be taking a look at my code, you're gonna need
at least some basic understandings of minecraft commands. If you dont understand
commands, you'll have to learn a bit about those first.

Not like it'll be impossible to understand this without understanding commands
but you will just be able to see everything and know it a bit better when you
already have some knowledge about it prior

Next make sure you know how datapacks work. Mainly all the packs code is located
in data/1_splatus/functions/spellbound

PLEASE ALSO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE VISUAL STUDIO CODE AND DATAPACK HELPER PLUS !!!
you will make bad packs without this. believe. me. it makes everything. so much.
EASIER !!!!






============================================
--- MAIN FUNCTION FILES AND INFO ---
============================================



/data/1_splatus/functions/spellbound/tick

This is the main function file of the entiiiiire pack. Branching functions are run
once certain actions are passed, such as a player holding a fire staff. Once
a fire staff is detected, a bunch of function files are run




/data/1_splatus/functions/spellbound/hit

Detects when a player hits another player or another mob. This file is performed
from the tick.mcfunction file covered above, when a scoreboard detecting damage
dealt increments on a player, it'll perform this function as that player




/data/1_splatus/functions/spellbound/[weapon_name]

All the functions for a certain weapon. Most of these will only load when
holding said weapon





/data/1_splatus/functions/spellbound/other/check_item

Runs this function when a player is detected holding a spellbound item. Then, 
it'll check for the specific item they are holding, and then load the functions
for that item in tick.mcfunction





/data/1_splatus/functions/spellbound/main

Main functions that aren't in the tick file for organization purposes. I dont
really know why I still have this file though i should just move it to the tick
file






/data/minecraft/loot_tables

All modified loot tables. They were changed to add the new weapons.





/data/1_splatus/functions/spellbound/cooldowns

Weapon cooldowns! Well, mainly resetting them when you remove them from
your mainhand / offhand





/data/1_splatus/item_modifiers

Updates weapon textures when neccessary




/data/1_splatus/predicates

Performs small checks, like a percent check, or a check to see if a player
is sneaking



/data/1_splatus/functions/spellbound/other/hits/

Not every hit is put here but mostly sword hits will be put here




Most entities are tagged with the tag prefix "spellbound_" in their tags list
Same with scoreboards, most also have this prefix.

I've tried to help those who wanna learn from my code by using hashtag (#)
comments throughout my code. They are there for organization purposes but also
so everything is easier to read through


Keep in mind optimization while you are coding your datapacks. Example, you dont
want to be constantly checking for if a fireball fired from a weapon is currently
at y100 when there's no players even holding the weapon. Don't run functions when
they dont need to be run because slowly your commands performed per tick will increment
into the hundreds and start lagging your datapack... A good goal is to have your datapack under 500 Commands per tick
in singleplayer. (Spellbound Weapons on average being about 200 Commands Per Tick
 in Singleplayer)
